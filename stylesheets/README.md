# Sass Folder Structure

This project uses (mostly) the **7-1 pattern** folder structure from the official **sass** guidelines. Refer to this [page](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) or [this boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) for the documentation on each folder/file purpose.
